# API

Welcome to the API documentation of the Sentry .NET SDK.

## Acquisition

This documentation include types which are part of different [NuGet packages provided by Sentry](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/sentry).
When visualizing a type, the documentation includes the name of the **Assembly** which contains that type.

Assembly names are equal to the NuGet package that contains the assembly.

For example, the @Sentry.Dsn class mentions:

> `Assembly: Sentry.dll`

This means the type resides in the NuGet package [Sentry](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry)

Looking at @Sentry.Extensions.Logging.SentryLoggerProvider you'll notice: 

> `Assembly: Sentry.Extensions.Logging.dll`

That assembly is found on NuGet [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Extensions.Logging)
